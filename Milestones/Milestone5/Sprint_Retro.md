# Sprint Retrospective Notes

## Safety check
All of us feel that we are at a 5 and that we are open to receiving constructive criticism and learning from eachother's strengths. 

## What did you learn from this sprint?
This sprint we learned the importance of understanding requirements, writing good user stories, that overestimating effort points is better than underestimating and a lot about Azure DevOps. 

## What still isn't going right? 

There were times when one person's work would affect whether or not someone could work on another part of the code. There is also still some confusion on how effort points should be estimated however this gets easier/clearer with time and practice. 

## What can the team do better during the next Sprint? Make a specific Action Plan

We have decided that we will overestimate our effort points. We will also write better descriptions for our Product Backlog Items so that it helps us to break down those PBIs into better, more detailed tasks. 

## Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)

We think that we can benefit from eachother's experiences and knowledge and are working well together so we do not need anyone from outside of the team at this time.
