2018-19 Team Project Inception: Pick-Up Sports Application
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development

With use of the discipline agile delivery methodology, we will deliver a website that allows users to find local pick-up games and share reviews/comments with their community regarding locations where games are played. 

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders

An application that allows users to find or host local sports pick-up games. If someone just wants to see what games are available in their area, they can login and enter the sport they wish to play and the website would provide a list of any nearby games happening so that user could join. If there are no games, users can start one! We also want to provide a way for users to be notified of games instead of only searching for one. To accomplish this, users can enter their preferred sports and times they are available tp play then when a game happens around that time, the application would notify the user. 

Users will also be able to see details on locations where pick up games are happpening or could happen. Such details could include times of operation, address, pictures, reviews, whether reservations are required, etc. In addition to seeing other reviews for locations, users will be given the option to leave a review. This application will give communities the opportunity to come together, get outside, and play. 

## List of Needs and Features 
1. A great looking landing page with info to tell the user what our site is all about and how to use it. Include a link to and a page with more info. Needs a page describing our company and our philosophy
2. The ability for any user (logged in or not) to see available and local sports pick-up games
3. User accounts
4. Users that are logged in should be able to set preferences for which sports they are interested and playing and at what times 
5. Users will be sent a notification if a pick-up game is happening during their preferred times
6. A user can choose to join a game if they are logged which will allow other users to see how many people are potentially signed up for a game
7. A user can choose to start a pick-up game at any given venue or time 
8. Information on venues such as availability, address, pictures, etc should be available to users 
9. Give users the ability to review venues and to also request that information displayed (such as address or times) be updated if incorrect

## Initial Modeling

### Use Case Diagrams

### Other Modeling

## Identify Non-Functional Requirements
1. User accounts and data must be stored indefinitely.
2. Site and data must be backed up regularly and have failover redundancy that will allow the site to remain functional in the event of loss of primary web server or primary database. We can live with 1 minute of complete downtime per event and up to 1 hour of read-only functionality before full capacity is restored.
3. Site should never return debug error pages. Web server must never return 404's. All server errors must be logged. Users should receive a custom error page in that case telling them what to do.
4. All sports venues' information pages must have a consistent format.
5. The website can run on any browser without messed up format.
6. The log in password should be encrypted for safety.
7. User has internet.
8. The layout should be self-explanatory enough so that any user needs only access the user manual to understand the functions of the product.

## Identification of Risks
One major risk is not being able to keep information about venues current. We will likely use Google's Places API to get information but unfortunately it's not easy to find dates that venues are open to the public nor is there an easy way to make reservations at such places. Another roadblock we face is finding an effective way to store dates/times that users are available to play that doesn't require storing date ranges directly in the database.
