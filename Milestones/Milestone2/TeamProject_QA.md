# Team Project Q/A

## Helpful Travel Application
**Overview**: An application that can help users find a place to vacation when they don't have a specifc place in mind. Users could input approximate price range, dates they'd like to travel, weather/climate they'd like to be in, how far they are willing to travel, and where they would like to travel from and the application would show ideal destinations including pricing for flights and hotels. 

Q. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)

A. We would want to build this application to be all inclusive where users would not only see what destinations they could visit, but also view local landmarks and sights and local news for destinations that are chosen for them. Jauntaroo is a comparable website which allows user to pick preferences however it only shows hotel pricing. 

Q. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?

A. This would be useful for anyone who wants to find a new place to travel, to find a place to travel within their budget, or just to find inspiration when picking destinations. 

Q. What are a few major features?

A. Some major features include:
1. A great looking landing page with info to tell the user how to use it and link to the home page.
2. A home page with a map to let users set their start location and some option or box to fill the preference of traveling.
3. The ability to search and show all the places on the map that match the user’s filters.
4. The ability to show the prices of the filght tickets when users touch the places marked on the map.
5. Allow users to tag or star the flight or place.
6. Provide a link for users to buy the filght tickets.
7. The filght tickets are sorted by price low to high as default, but users can also sort them by time.

Q. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.

A. Some outside resource that we will require:
1. This project needs an additional api to add a map in the webpage.
2. This project needs the data of the flight tickets and maybe the hotels.
3. This project needs to tag the places or classify places so the result can match the users' filters.( Maybe there is an api for this function or we nned to tag them by ourselves, like the interesting words or boring words in the last term's project, but there will be a lot of work...)

Q. What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)

A. Dijkstra，Probabilistic Road Maps，BFS. We would like to add in a feature that would analyze which places were picked by which demographics during certain times of year. This would help to figure out which offers perform better. 

Q. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

A. 10


## Pick-Up Sports Application
**Overview**:  An application that allows users to find or host local sports pick-up games. Users could enter sports they wish to play and what times and/or locations work best for them and the application could search for other users with the same preferences set and allow users who sign up for a pick-up game to chat if they need to coordinate. The application will also show venues/locations where games take place. This feature would allow users to see details (such as timees of operation) for locations of games and also give an opportunity to leave reviews or feedback on those locations. 

Q. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)

A. An application that does something similar is OpenSports which is a mobile aplication for pick up sports. The difference between this idea and the OpenSports app is that the OpenSports app doesn't have a way to see details or leave feedback about locations.

Q. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?

A. Not only does it have the capability of getting the community together for a pick up sport game, but it also allows users to see the information about certain locations that the users can reserve. It could contain the availability, the times that are crowded, and the overall review of the place left by other users. 

Q. What are a few major features?

A. Some major features include:
1. Sending notifications to other users when there are a certain number of players available for a certain location/sport. 
2. Being able to set an approximate of when the user will be at the location. 
3. Viewing the location information which includes availability, reviews, and reservations. 

Q. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.

A. Some outside resources that we will require:
1. We would need a map/location API
2. Some sort of analytic API (Google)
3. An API to access the data for the locations or we could find out details of these locations ourselves and store to database

Q. What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)

A. Analytics to figure out which sport is most frequently played at which location, finding out times of locations that are crowded. 

Q. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

A. 8 - 9
